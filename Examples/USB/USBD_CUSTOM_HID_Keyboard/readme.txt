&par Example Description

This example describes how to use USBD to simulate a custom HID keyboard.
Press KEY1 will send the report descriptor of a - z or Enter to the USB host.
The state of Capslock and numlock determine whether LED2 and LED3 are on or off.  

&par Hardware Description

The USART1 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

    - VCC5V         ----------> VBUS
    - USBD_DM(PA11) ----------> USB_DN
    - USBD_DP(PA12) ----------> USB_DP
    - GND           ----------> GND
