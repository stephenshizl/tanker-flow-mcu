&par Example Description

The program shows how to  using USART IrDA mode, in this case,
USART1 sends data to upper computer. You can check the data in a Serial Port Utility

  - USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10) configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =   115200
  - Word Length =   USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =   USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =   USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Transmit enabled

USARTx configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =   115200 baud
  - Word Length =   USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =   USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =   USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

To use this example, the user needs to prepare two IrDA modules.
   VCC             ---> 1# IrDA module VCC
   GND             ---> 1# IrDA module GND
   PA2(USART2_TX)  ---> 1# IrDA module TX
   PA3(USART2_RX)  ---> 1# IrDA module TX

   VCC             ---> 2# IrDA module VCC
   GND             ---> 2# IrDA module GND
   PB10(USART3_TX) ---> 2# IrDA module TX
   PB11(USART3_RX) ---> 2# IrDA module TX
