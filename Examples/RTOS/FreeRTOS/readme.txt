&par Example Description

This example describes show how to use FreeRTOS create multiple tasks.

Usart test task : USART1 and USART2 send or received data to each other. Verification will occur after transmission,
if send and received data pass, LED3 will be on all the time.
if send and received data fault, LED3 will be off all the time.
if send or received data fault, LED3 will be constantly flickered alternately.

Led toggle task : The IO of LED2 is configed to toggle constantly

The phenomenon of LED2 constantly flickered alternately,
if Data transmission pass, LED3 will be on, and data interaction process can be displayed using serial assistant.

&par Software Description

Please install the following dependencies in the directory where the installation package resides beforehand.
  - Middlewares/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOSv202012.00-LTS.exe   FreeRTOS Software Components

&par Hardware Description
