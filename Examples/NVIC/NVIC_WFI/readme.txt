&par Example Description

This example describes how to use WFI event to enter sleep mode and wake up
using external interrupt.
At startup, press KEY1(PA1) to occur Wait For Interrupt(WFI) event, and device
will enter sleep mode. The device will wake up if press KEY1 again.
The status of device is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

&par Hardware Description

EINT0 is connected to PA1 (KEY1)

using USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =   115200
  - Word Length =   USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =   USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =   USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled


&par Software Description

After Initialization, ADC1 start to transform and show volatage information to USART1
