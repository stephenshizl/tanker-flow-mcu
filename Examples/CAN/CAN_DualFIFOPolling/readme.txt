&par Example Description

This example shows how to configurate CAN peripheral in normal mode, then
to send and receive CAN frames in polling mode and using FIFO0 and FIFO1.
The CAN send frames use two different standard identifier.
When two boards KEY1 is pressed, two boards send and receive CAN frames
to each other.

using USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10) to Board1 and Board2.
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =  115200
  - Word Length =  USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =  USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =  USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
