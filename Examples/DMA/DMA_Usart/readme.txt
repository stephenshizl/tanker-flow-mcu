&par Example Description

This example provides a basic communication between USART1 and USART2 using DMA1
capability.

After system reset, USART2 Transmit data from DMA_USART_TxBuf to USART1.
Data received by USART1 is transferred by DMA and stored in DMA_USART_RxBuf.
If the data of DMA_USART_TxBuf and DMA_USART_RxBuf are the same,
LED2 will light,otherwise, LED3 will light.


USART2_TX (PA2)  --->   USART1_RX (PA10)
