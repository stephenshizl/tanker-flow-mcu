&par Example Description

This example describes how to use the ADC1 scan the input values of
all ADC external channels(ADC_CH0-ADC_CH15) one by one.
The converted voltage is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

&par Hardware Description

using ADC_Channel0-7(PA0-PA7)
using ADC_Channel8-9(PB0-PB1)
using ADC_Channel10-15(PC0-PC5)

using USART1(TX:PA9、RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =  115200
  - Word Length =  USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =  USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =  USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
