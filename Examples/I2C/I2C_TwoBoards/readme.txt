&par Example Description

This example shows how to control I2C devices and communicate between two different boards.

To use this example, you need to load the same software into two mini boards
(let's call them  Board master and Board Slave) then connect these two boards
through I2C lines and GND.

 - At startup, Boards master and slave are both in slave receiver mode and wait for messages
   to be received.
 - When KEY1 is pressed on Board master, the master transmitter sents "Hello master" to Board slave.
   The message is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.
 - When KEY1 is pressed on Board slave, the slave transmitter sents "Hello master" to Board master.
   The message is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

&par Hardware Description

   I2C     BOARD1    BOARD2
   SCL      PB8       PB8     (External Pull up resistance)
   SDA      PB9       PB9     (External Pull up resistance)

using USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =   115200
  - Word Length =   USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =   USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =   USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
